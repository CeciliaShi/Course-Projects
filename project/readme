We are interested in the national house prices across counties in the mainland United States. Therefore, we do visualization on shiny app to help readers access those data interactively. Specifically, we first scrape national housing median price data at the state level from Trulia. com. Since we are particularly interested in how factors like income, population, property tax rate, crime rate and education level would be like in a specific region with certain housing price (according to our preliminary linear regression analysis, those variables would significantly influence the average housing prices), we also scrape those data from several websites. As a result, when a house buyer considers his or her housing plan, he can use our product for reference. As for our variables: income: median household income in 2014; population: population for a state in 2014; property tax rate: annual tax rate for a house in 2014; crime rate: violate crime count in every 100k population in 2014; education level: the percentage of people who hold a bachelor degree in a state in 2014.

For our shiny app, we created an interactive map at the county level across the country for average listing prices for housing. We also add features as “pop-up”, that is, when we click on the specific region in the map, the data on average price, county name and state name will be presented. And we can also zoom in and zoom out as we want.

Then, we also conduct visualizations for other five variables at state level: income, population, property tax rate, crime rate and education level. We set widgets to allow the users to choose the variable of interests, and a map related to those information will be displayed.
